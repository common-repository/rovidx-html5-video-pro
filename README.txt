Yes, but that\'s ok because you can do all kinds of cool things via add-ons like Roku feeds

=Why is this plugin so basic?=

Because we are still really expermenting with HTML5 video.   As such we want to keep it simple to use and add-on features slowly.   We hope to upgrade our player in the coming months to support Chromecast, and plan out features from there.
